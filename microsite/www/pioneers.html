				<p class="p1">The 19th century produced an explosion of innovators and inventors who perfected the design and production of beehives, systems of management and husbandry, stock improvement by selective breeding, honey extraction and marketing. Preeminent among these innovators were:

			<br>
				
						<span class="name">Petro Prokopovych</span>, used frames with channels in the side of the woodwork; these were packed side by side in boxes that were stacked one on top of the other. The bees traveled from frame to frame and box to box via the channels. The channels were similar to the cut outs in the sides of modern wooden sections (1814).
					<br><br>
						<span class="name">Jan Dzier≈ºon</span>, was the father of modern apiology and apiculture. All modern beehives are descendants of his design.
					<br><br>
						<span class="name">L. L. Langstroth</span>, revered as the "father of American apiculture"; no other individual has influenced modern beekeeping practice more than Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. His classic book The Hive and Honey-bee was published in 1853.
					<br><br>
						<span class="name">Moses Quinby</span>, often termed "the father of commercial beekeeping in the United States", author of Mysteries of Bee-Keeping Explained. He invented the Bee smoker in 1873.
					<br><br>
						<span class="name">Amos Root</span>, author of the A B C of Bee Culture, which has been continuously revised and remains in print. Root pioneered the manufacture of hives and the distribution of bee-packages in the United States.

						<span class="name">A. J. Cook</span>, author of The Bee-Keepers' Guide; or Manual of the Apiary, 1876.
					<br><br>
						<span class="name">Dr. C.C. Miller</span> was one of the first entrepreneurs to actually make a living from apiculture. By 1878 he made beekeeping his sole business activity. His book, Fifty Years Among the Bees, remains a classic and his influence on bee management persists to this day.
					<br><br>
						<span class="name">Franz Hruschka</span> was an Italian military officer who made one crucial invention that catalyzed the commercial honey industry. In 1865 he invented a simple machine for extracting honey from the comb by means of centrifugal force. His original idea was simply to support combs in a metal framework and then spin them around within a container to collect honey as it was thrown out by centrifugal force. This meant that honeycombs could be returned to a hive undamaged but empty, saving the bees a vast amount of work, time, and materials. This single invention greatly improved the efficiency of honey harvesting and catalysed the modern honey 
						<br><br>
						<span class="name">Walter T. Kelley</span> was an American pioneer of modern beekeeping in the early and mid-20th century. He greatly improved upon beekeeping equipment and clothing and went on to manufacture these items as well as other equipment. His company sold via catalog worldwide and his book, How to Keep Bees & Sell Honey, an introductory book of apiculture and marketing, allowed for a boom in beekeeping following World War II.
