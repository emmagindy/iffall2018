	<p> This is a recipe that I found while trying to recreate the delicious homemade granola bars from Kayak's, right across from campus. I wanted to create a  ~healthier alternative to storebought granola bars, and who doesn't love a good mix of salty and sweet. Over time I've altered this recipe little by little to find just how I like it, so take this with a grain of salt (pun intented) to create your perfect granola bar.

	<div class="step">step 1</div>
		<p> Line an 8 to 9-inch square baker with two strips of criss-crossed parchment paper, cut to size. In a mixing bowl, combine the oats, almonds, chocolate chips, cinnamon and salt. Whisk to combine.</p><br>
	<div class="step">step 2</div>
	<p>In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, measure out the nut butter. Top with ½ cup honey and the vanilla extract. Whisk until well blended. If you must, you can gently warm the liquid mixture on the stovetop or in the microwave, but make sure it’s cool before you pour it into the dry mixture (the chocolate chips will melt).</p><br>
	<div class="step">step 3</div>
	<p>Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients. Use a big spoon to mix them together until the two are evenly combined and no dry oats remain. The drier the mixture, the more firm the bars will be, so stir in extra oats if the mixture seems wet.</p><br>
	<div class="step">step 4</div>
	<p>Transfer the mixture to the prepared square baker. Use your spoon to arrange the mixture fairly evenly in the baker, then use the bottom of a flat, round surface (like a short, sturdy drinking glass), covered in a small piece of parchment paper (see photo), to pack the mixture down as firmly and evenly as possible.</p><br>
	<div class="step">step 5</div>
	<p>Cover the baker and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight. Use a sharp knife to slice the bars. For portability, you can wrap individual bars in plastic wrap or parchment paper. Bars keep well for a couple of days at room temperature, but I recommend storing individually wrapped bars in a freezer-safe bag in the freezer for best flavor.</p><br>
