	<h1>Feedback for Rohit</h1>
	<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I like your choice of images, they are all clear and interesting.</li>
			<li>I'm not sure if you need a black box behind each of your quotes, maybe consider finding a place on the image that the text could sit and still be legible. (that might mean making the text bigger or smaller to fit in those spaces)</li>
			<li>Also be careful that you don't have a quote where there is only one word on the last line. (your first set)</li>
			<li>If you still do want to have a black box with the quote in it, I think it is working better on the ones that the box spans the whole width of the image.</li>
			<li>If you want to highlight one word of the quote in a color as you're doing now, maybe choose the color from the image itself. (for example in your first, blue picture, make that colored word the same blue as the background.</li>	
			<li>Consider having a larger size shift between the font for the quote and the font for who said it.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Structure</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You've established a strong use of foreground/background. The images are clearly background.</li>
			<li>Accomodates the shift in browser size well.</li>

		</ul>
	
	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Everything here looks good to me!</li>
		</ul>
